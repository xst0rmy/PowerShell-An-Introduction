# PowerShell-An-Introduction
Prior to today, I didn't know PowerShell had such great potentials. I want to share some cool stuffs about PowerShell... Hopefully, you learn to love PowerShell as am learning to. I will also create other PowerShell repositories about other features I learn. 

> **First things first, Always run PowerShell as Administrator. It gives you an unrestricted access to all PowerShell funtionalities, so why not?**

> **Always start your PowerShell session with a "Start-Transcipt" command if for any reason you wish to go through all you've done in that session. I'll talk more on this**

> **Did you noticed how the first command was written as "Start-Transcript". I'll use that example to describe the verb-noun assignment of functions to commands. Most PowerShell commands are written in a way that helps the reader understand what that command would likely perform. Commands in Powershell are easy to write out and execute when they are in the verb-noun state.

> **It also important to note that PowerShell is case-insensitive. The "Tab" key on the keyboard can be used to automatically select a command after you've written some letters (keep clicking the tab key till you get the command you want). I will suggest you use the tab key in the noun section of the command because the verb section of PowerShell commands have numerous similar starting commands). Using the "Tab" key to auto-generate a command produces the command with the first alphabet of the verb-noun words in Capital Letters.**
